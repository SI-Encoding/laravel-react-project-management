# laravel-react-project-management

---

This single-page application (SPA) combines **Laravel**, **React**, and **Inertia.js** to demonstrate CRUD functionalities for managing projects. 

- **Laravel**: A PHP web framework, Laravel handles server-side logic, routing, and database interactions.
- **React**: A JavaScript library used to create an interactive user interface and manage client-side state changes.
- **Inertia.js**: A package that integrates Laravel’s server-side routing and rendering with React’s client-side components, creating a seamless SPA experience without the need for a traditional API.

The application is designed to demonstrate CRUD operations in a modern web development environment.
